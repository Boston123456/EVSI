\title{Calculates the EVSI accross willingness-to-pay, sample size and gives uncertainty for these
measurements as required. This function can be fed into/used in the other plot functions
This should allow people to upload their own EVSI matrices and still use the plotting capabilities.}
\usage{
evsi.calc(comp.evsi.N, wtp = NULL, N = NULL, CI = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{comp.evsi.N}{Output of the comp.evsi.N function}

\item{wtp}{The willingness to pay value(s) for which the EVSI should be calculated.
It will be chosen as all the wtp values if NULL.}

\item{N}{The sample sizes for which the EVSI should be calculated. If NULL it will select
all the values that the EVSI has been calculated for. NOTE: N can be chosen as any
value but wtp needs to be on the grid chosen in comp.evsi.N.}

\item{CI}{The confidence levels for the credible intervals of the EVSI. If NULL chosen as
  c(0.025,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.975)

OUTPUTS}
}
\value{
An evsi object.
1. evsi An array containing the EVSI by wtp, N and across different uncertaincies
2. attrib A list of wtp, N and prob describing the attributes of the evsi matrix.
3. evppi An evppi object containing all the information about the calculation of
  EVPPI.
4. he A bcea object containing all the information about the underlying health
  economic model
