\title{Calculating the EVSI for a specific WTP giving the uncertainty bands across the different
samples sizes}
\usage{
\method{plot}{evsi.N}(evsi, wtp = NULL, pos = c("bottomright"), CI = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{wtp}{The willingness to pay value that the graphic should be produced for - it will
be chosen if wtp=NULL.}

\item{CI}{The indexes that we would like to take from the CI in the evsi object.}

\item{comp.evsi.N}{Output of the comp.evsi.N function}

\item{prob}{The confidence levels for the uncertainty bands.}
}
\value{
EVSI The EVSI calculated for a specific wtp with uncertainty estimates.

A graphical representation of the uncertainty.
